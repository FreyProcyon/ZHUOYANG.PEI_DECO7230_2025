Week 2 â€“ Paper Prototype & User Testing
This week, we focused on creating a paper prototype of a 3D modeling tool to quickly validate ideas for interaction methods and interface layout.

Making the Paper Prototype
I first simulated a floating toolbar using cardboard and sticky notes. I drew the tool buttons and taped them to a piece of cardboard for easy movement.
The modeling objects used squares and long strips of cardboard to simulate the common volume models in Rhino.
I also sketched a simple VR view interface, including the main modeling area, toolbar placement, and zoom/fly control prompts.

User Testing Process
Two students were invited to participate in the test. They pretended to wear a VR headset, "clicked" the toolbar buttons in mid-air, and pushed and pulled the paper volume.
Observe whether they naturally reach for the toolbar and whether they accidentally touch other areas during push and pull movements.
Based on their reactions, I will adjust the toolbar position appropriately, such as moving it from the left to the right.

Key Findings
Toolbar Position: Most people prefer the toolbar on their dominant hand (right hand) rather than directly in front of them.
Push and Pull Movement: When the volume is large, pushing is more natural than pulling, but it can easily obstruct vision.
Flying Mode: Everyone is interested in "flying to the top of the model to look down," but they are concerned about the potential for motion sickness from rapid movements.

Next Steps
Implement switchable toolbar positions in the VR prototype to support left-handed and right-handed users.
Introduce a translucent mode for push and pull movements to reduce occlusion issues.
Add gradual movement to flying mode to reduce motion sickness.
