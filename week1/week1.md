Week 1: Getting Started

This week was my first proper hands-on experience with XR. During the studio session, we got to try out different AR/VR headsets. I tested an AR-based game and honestly, it was a lot more fun and intuitive than I expected. It was interesting to see how the game responded to real-world movement — I could walk around, use my hands to interact with floating UI, and everything felt quite "present", not like looking at a screen.

Some of the interactions I noticed: hand tracking (no controller needed), tapping in the air to confirm, physically walking up to things, and elements staying anchored to the environment. I especially liked how natural it felt to "touch" things — even though it was virtual, it made sense spatially.


Early Idea for XR Re-Design

After the session, I started thinking about what kind of app could benefit from being turned into an XR experience. I’m interested in 3D modelling and have used Rhino and a bit of CAD before, so I thought — why not try to reimagine that workflow for XR?

The main idea is to let people model directly in 3D space with their hands, kind of like sculpting. For example, instead of typing coordinates or dragging sliders, you could just push and pull on a block to resize it, grab it with both hands to scale it up, or pinch the surface to make finer adjustments. It would be like combining digital geometry with the immediacy of clay.

One cool possibility is using both gesture and spatial awareness — maybe walking around your model to see it from all angles, and using your body to naturally "orbit" it instead of dragging with a mouse. You could even use snapping systems or basic voice commands like "extrude" or "mirror" to support more complex modelling tasks.

It’s still early, but I think this could be a really intuitive way to work with 3D forms, especially for designers who think spatially. My next step is to define a few modelling tasks that could be tested in a simple prototype — like resizing, rotating, or duplicating a shape — and then build a lo-fi version of that for testing next week.
